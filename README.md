### What I learned

I've never thought about using padding and margin at this large scale.
But it came as a good idea to use all of that for most properties.
That is annoying at first, But it's finally completed,
It took me approximately 2-3 hours to finish it with some simple div without html5.

### Continued development

Amm, I'm gonna put some efforts on understanding Box modals and padding and margin.

### Useful resources

- [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhaz36TZG5Y) - This helped me understand some missing concepts during the creation of that project, especially the part of the Firefox browser box modal.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_main.asp) - This was a great help with HTML5 as you saw in commented section
